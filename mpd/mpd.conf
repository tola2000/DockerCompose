Steps to use:
Create the directory if it doesn’t exist:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /home/domotica/mpd
Save the configuration:

bash
Copy code
nano /home/domotica/mpd/mpd.conf
Paste the content above and save.

Ensure permissions are correct:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/domotica/mpd
(Docker MPD containers often run as UID 1000)

Then start your container:

bash
Copy code
sudo docker compose up
If you want, I can also adjust this mpd.conf specifically for Docker volumes, so it directly uses /mpd/music and /mpd/playlists from your host. This avoids editing paths inside the container. Do you want me to do that?
